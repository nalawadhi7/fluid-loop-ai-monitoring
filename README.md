# AI-Driven Fluid Loop Monitoring, Fault Detection & Diagnosis System

An end-to-end intelligent monitoring and fault diagnosis system designed around a physical fluid loop. The project combines real-time sensor data acquisition (Arduino), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) for explainable root-cause reasoning, machine learning–based state classification, and an AI-powered web platform that turns raw readings into actionable insights through dashboards, alerts, and operator-friendly guidance.

Focus areas: Industrial Monitoring • Explainable Fault Diagnosis • Machine Learning • Human-Centered Dashboard Design
